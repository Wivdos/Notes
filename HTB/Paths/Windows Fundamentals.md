|Users                     |This folder contains user profiles for each user that logs onto the system and contains the two folders Public and Default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|Default                   |This is the default user profile template for all created users. Whenever a new user is added to the system, their profile is based on the Default profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|Public                    |This folder is intended for computer users to share files and is accessible to all users by default. This folder is shared over the network by default but requires a valid network account to access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|AppData                   |Per user application data and settings are stored in a hidden user subfolder (i.e., cliff.moore\AppData). Each of these folders contains three subfolders. The Roaming folder contains machine-independent data that should follow the user's profile, such as custom dictionaries. The Local folder is specific to the computer itself and is never synchronized across the network. LocalLow is similar to the Local folder, but it has a lower data integrity level. Therefore it can be used, for example, by a web browser set to protected or safe mode.|
|Windows                   |The majority of the files required for the Windows operating system are contained here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|System, System32, SysWOW64|Contains all DLLs required for the core features of Windows and the Windows API. The operating system searches these folders any time a program asks to load a DLL without specifying an absolute path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|WinSxS                    |The Windows Component Store contains a copy of all Windows components, updates, and service packs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
*lsass.exe* is the process that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on Windows systems. When a user attempts to log on to the system, this process verifies their log on attempt and creates access tokens based on the user's permission levels. LSASS is also responsible for user account password changes. All events associated with this process (logon/logoff attempts, etc.) are logged within the Windows Security Log. LSASS is an extremely high-value target as several tools exist to extract both cleartext and hashed credentials stored in memory by this process.

## Windows Security
Windows follows certain security principles. These are units in the system that can be authorized or authenticated for a particular action. These units include users, computers on the network, threads, or processes. The principles are designed to make it more difficult for attackers or malicious software to gain unauthorized access and exploit the system in an unintended way.

### SID
A SID consists of the Identifier Authority and the Relative ID (RID). In an Active Directory (AD) domain environment, the SID also includes the domain SID.
SIDs are broken down into:
**(SID)-(revision level)-(identifier-authority)-(subauthority1)-(subauthority2)-(etc)**

|Number                         |Meaning               |Description|
|-------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
|S                              |SID                   |Identifies the string as a SID.|
|1                              |Revision Level        |To date, this has never changed and has always been 1.|
|5                              |Identifier-authority  |A 48-bit string that identifies the authority (the computer or network) that created the SID.|
|21                             |Subauthority1         |This is a variable number that identifies the user's relation or group described by the SID to the authority that created it. It tells us in what order this authority created the user's account.|
|674899381-4069889467-2080702030|Subauthority2         |Tells us which computer (or domain) created the number|
|1002                           |Subauthority3         |The RID that distinguishes one account from another. Tells us whether this user is a normal user, a guest, an administrator, or part of some other group|

### Security Accounts Manager (SAM) and Access Control Entries (ACE)
SAM grants rights to a network to execute specific processes.

The access rights themselves are managed by Access Control Entries (ACE) in Access Control Lists (ACL). The ACLs contain ACEs that define which users, groups, or processes have access to a file or to execute a process, for example.

The permissions to access a securable object are given by the security descriptor, classified into two types of ACLs: the *Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)* or *System Access Control List (SACL)*. Every thread and process started or initiated by a user goes through an authorization process. An integral part of this process is access tokens, validated by the Local Security Authority (LSA). In addition to the SID, these access tokens contain other security-relevant information. Understanding these functionalities is an essential part of learning how to use and work around these security mechanisms during the privilege escalation phase.

The entire system registry is stored in several files on the operating system. You can find these under *C:\\Windows\\System32\\Config\\*.
The user-specific registry hive (HKCU) is stored in the user folder (i.e., *C:\\Windows\\Users\\\<USERNAME\>\\Ntuser.dat*).

### Run and RunOnce Registry Keys
There are also so-called registry hives, which contain a logical group of keys, subkeys, and values to support software and files loaded into memory when the operating system is started or a user logs in. These hives are useful for maintaining access to the system. These are called [Run and RunOnce registry keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/setupapi/run-and-runonce-registry-keys).

The Windows registry includes the following four keys:
- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run
- HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run
- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce
- HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce

## Application Whitelisting
An application whitelist is a list of approved software applications or executables allowed to be present and run on a system. The goal is to protect the environment from harmful malware and unapproved software that does not align with the specific business needs of an organization. Implementing an enforced whitelist can be a challenge, especially in a large network. An organization should implement a whitelist in audit mode initially to make sure that all necessary applications are whitelisted and not blocked by an error of omission, which can cause more problems than it fixes.

Blacklisting, in contrast, specifies a list of harmful or disallowed software/applications to block, and all others are allowed to run/be installed. Whitelisting is based on a "zero trust" principle in which all software/applications are deemed "bad" except for those specifically allowed. Maintaining a whitelist generally has less overheard as a system administrator will only need to specify what is allowed and not constantly update a "blacklist" with new malicious applications.

Whitelisting is recommended by organizations such as [NIST](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-167.pdf), especially in high-security environments.

## AppLocker

[AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview) is Microsoft's application whitelisting solution and was first introduced in Windows 7. AppLocker gives system administrators control over which applications and files users can run. It gives granular control over executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs, packaged apps, and packed app installers.

It allows for creating rules based on file attributes such as the publisher's name (which can be derived from the digital signature), product name, file name, and version. Rules can also be set up based on file paths and hashes. Rules can be applied to either security groups or individual users, based on the business need. AppLocker can be deployed in audit mode first to test the impact before enforcing all of the rules.
